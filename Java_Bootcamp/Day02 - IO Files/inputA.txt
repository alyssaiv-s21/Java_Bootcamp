Input/output classes in Java are represented by a broad hierarchy. The key classes describing byte input/output behavior are abstract classes InputStream and OutputStream. They do not implement specific mechanisms for byte flows processing, rather delegate them to their subclasses, such as FileInputStream/FileOutputStream.
To understand the use of this functionality, you should implement an application for analyzing signatures of arbitrary files. This signature allows to define file content type and consists of a set of "magic numbers." These numbers are usually located in the beginning of the file. For example, a signature for PNG file type is represented by first eight bytes of a file that are equal for all PNG images:
