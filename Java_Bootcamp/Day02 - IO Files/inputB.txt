In addition to classes designed to handle byte flows, Java has classes to simplify handling of character flows (char). These include abstract classes Reader/Writer, as well as their implementations (FileReader/FileWriter, etc.). Of special interest are BufferedReader/BufferedWriter classes which accelerate flow handling via buffering mechanisms.
Now you need to implement an application that will determine the level of similarity between texts. The simplest and most obvious method to do this is to analyze the frequency of occurrence of the same words.
Let's assume that we have two following texts:
